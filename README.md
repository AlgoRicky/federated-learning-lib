# federated-learning-lib
IBM Federated Learning lib is a library for federated learning (FL), a distributed machine learning process in which each participant node (or party) retains data locally and interacts with the other participants via a learning protocol. The main driver behind FL is the need to not share data with others, mainly driven by privacy and confidentiality concerns.
