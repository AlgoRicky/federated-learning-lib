title: "About IBM Federated Learning"
---

IBM federated learning is a framework for federated learning (FL) in an enterprise environment. FL is a distributed machine learning process, in which each participant node
(or party) retains data locally and interacts with the other participants via
a learning protocol. 
The main driver behind FL is the need to not share data with others,
mainly driven by privacy and confidentiality concerns.

IBM federated learning provides a basic fabric for FL, upon which advanced features can be added.
It is not dependent on any specific machine learning framework and supports different learning topologies,
e.g., an shared aggregator, and protocols.  This is a team effort of multiple IBM Research teams in Almaden, Yorktown Heights, and Dublin.
It is meant to provide a solid basis for FL that enables a large variety of FL models, topologies, learning models etc., particularly within enterprise settings.

FL is still in its infancy.
Many aspects of machine learning have to be re-thought within the frame of privacy constraints,
including hyper-parameter tuning, model privacy,
privacy budget-sensitive optimization, and more.
IBM federated learning provides a robust foundation for this advanced work,
and a target to which you can contribute your own FL ideas.
