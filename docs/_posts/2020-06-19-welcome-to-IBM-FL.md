Welcome to IBM Federated Learning. IBM Federated Learning is a framework for federated learning (FL), a distributed machine learning process in which each participant node (or party) retains data locally and interacts with the other participants via a learning protocol. The main driver behind FL is the need to not share data with others, mainly driven by privacy and confidentiality concerns.

We invite you to browse these pages -- the fastest way to get started with IBM FL is the quickstart guide.
